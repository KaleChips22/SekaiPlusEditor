# Sekai Plus Editor

A _brand-new_ chart editor for making custom charts for Sonolus.
The goal of this program is to work as an up-to-date charting program, similar to those like [MikuMikuWorld](https://github.com/crash5band/MikuMikuWorld), [MikuMikuWorld4CC](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi/MikuMikuWorld4CC), and similar programs.

## Download

Unfortunately, there is no download available yet, as I am not finished making this app. When a stable, working release is ready, it will be available here.

## Electron

This editor is made in electron, which should make it more compatible with a lot more devices, including MacOS support!

## Progress

My goal is to have all of the features from MikuMikuWorld available first, then MikuMikuWorld4CC, then other stuff. So far I have very little done. Once I complete more, I will post it up here.
